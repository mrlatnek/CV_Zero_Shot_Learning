We consider two related problems of Outlier Detection and Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) using Siamese Network (SN) and Case-to-Case Siamese Networks (C2C-SN). The present methods of ZSL and outlier detection use semi-supervised techniques like transfer learning, data augmentation by adding synthetic or out-of-distribution images, vector embeddings for training. These methods will fail for a novice observation. We propose a method based on Case Based Reasoning (CBR) using simple Siamese Networks and Case-to-Case Siamese Networks (C2C-SN) for the task of Fully Unsupervised Outlier Detection and Fully Unsupervised Zero Shot Learning.
